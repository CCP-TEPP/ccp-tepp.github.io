NPRAISE intends to fund up to six (6) RTPs,
each for at most 12 months
(or more based on part-time efforts).
The funded RTPs will be working alongside
experts in the AI for Science Theme at STFC,
and with their individual community.
The AI for Science theme will provide
mentorship,
training,
and will aim to upskill the funded RTPs on AI
while the community provides domain expertise and applications.
While some of the time will be spent on training,
the critical part of the upskilling process is working together with experts
on addressing a key real-world challenge that is of interest to the community.
All RTPs must spend an agreed amount of time on site,
either at the Harwell or Daresbury Innovation Campus.

NPRAISE will fund up to £80,000 at 80% FeC per RTP,
including travel and subsistence costs,
with RTPs starting no later than September 2026 for up to a year,
or up to November 2027 at the latest.
We are flexible about part-time applications
or RTPs with caring responsibilities.
The closing date for applications is Wednesday 25 February 2026, 4pm.
